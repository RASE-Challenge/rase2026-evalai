Submissions will be evaluated using both objective and perceptual metrics to ensure fair and holistic assessment.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality):</b> Measures perceptual quality of enhanced speech compared to clean reference.</li>
  <li><b>ESTOI (Extended Short-Time Objective Intelligibility):</b> Estimates intelligibility of speech in noisy environments.</li>
  <li><b>DNSMOS:</b> A neural networkâ€“based non-intrusive measure of speech naturalness and quality.</li>
  <li><b>MFCC Similarity:</b> Compares mel-frequency cepstral coefficients between enhanced and reference signals to capture spectral fidelity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A final <b>weighted composite score</b> will be calculated by combining all metrics. Leaderboards will be ranked based on this composite score. 
Baseline models and their performance will be provided for reference.
